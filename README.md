## Content-Based Landmark Retrieval Combining Global and Local Features using Siamese Neural Networks

This paper mainly introduces the use of GLD-v2 dataset for landmark retrieval tasks. This paper uses [Google landmark dataset](https://github.com/cvdfoundation/google-landmark) for image retrieval. The method used is to combine the global and local features of the image. <br/>
<br/>
The research points of this paper are divided into 4 points in total: <br/>
<br/>
(1) What is the characteristics of the Landmark Retrieval data set? <br/>
(2) How to better design a Landmark Retrieval system on top of a large-scaled noisy data set? <br/>
(3) Which local feature is suitable for codebook Construction? <br/>
(4) How to incorporate local Features and global Features for landmark re-ranking? <br/>
<br/>
RQ1 I downloaded the data set of the [kaggle competition](, and deeply analyzed the number of noise images in the data set, the gray-scale images in the data set, the number of images in each category, the shooting time of each image, exif information, etc. In-depth analysis. The relevant code is in the download_mac folder. <br/>
